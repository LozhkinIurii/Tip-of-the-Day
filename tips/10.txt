The shell contains a separate set of metacharacters that remove the special meaning of other shell metacharacters. When a character loses its meta-meaning, it is said to be quoted. Shell offers backslash (\) to quote any single character and in single quotes A command like cat file1&2 would result several errors, quoting the ampersand with backslash returns the original file name. As before, the shell removes the quoting metacharacters from the command line before executing it.

      echo "test" > file1\&2

      cat  file1\&2

      echo "invisible" > \ .txt
      cat \ .txt
